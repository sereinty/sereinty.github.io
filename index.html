<h2 id="char">Characters</h2>
<p>One of the best parts of the game in my opinion are the characters! They add heart to the game and without it, it would be very <em class="big">boring!</em></p>Thankfully as mentioned previously, Cookie Run Kingdom has 167 cookies currently.. <em class="bigger">WHICH IS A LOT!</em> Each cookie is unique with a story, design and strength! This shows that DEVSISTERS is devoted to creating a wonderful experience for each cookie making the game more fun for players. CRK also centers a cookie's design, personality and overall character based on the flavour of the cookie. There is a good chance your favourite cookie flavour is a character!
 <p class="favs">
   Some of my favourite cookies are...
	</p>
<a href="https://cookierunkingdom.fandom.com/wiki/MyCookie_Adventure">Black Licorice Cookie</a></p>
   <div class="fav-cookies">
   <img class="evil-licorice" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTZwtGz547bjjac6WL06WFfYqjyVPsrSd14nA&s" alt="Black Licorice Cookie" width="300">
   <p><span class="ending-sentence">Black Licorice Cookie is one of the minions of the evil Dark Enchantress Cookie (one of the major villains in the lore) and he is a magic type and considered a Epic in terms of rarity.</p> 	<p>Like many players, I love this cookie! His apperance is very cool and he is considered a villain, naking his backstory just as cool as his apperance. He has a cool black robe with a licorice sythe. He is a playable character and summons cute licorice warriors to fight for the player's team which gives defense for the player's team. </p>

<div>
	<div class="sea-fairy">
<p> The next cookie is <a href="https://cookierunkingdom.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Fairy_Cookie">Sea Fairy Cookie!</a></p>

  <p><span class="intro-fairy">Sea Fairy Cookie is a bomber type cookie and has is considered a water element type. She reigns over the seas and controls all the oceans. She is considered a Legendary in terms of rarity and was the first legendary cookie added into the game. </p> 	<p>I love this cookie as I started playing around 4 years ago when it laumched. Sea Fairy was one of the rarest cookies at the time which created a desire for her. She also has a very beautiful design and used to be META which means she used to extremelty powerful. Although Sea Fairy isn't META anymore, I still have love for her since she brings back nostalgic memories. </p>

	<p> Finally, we have... <a href="https://cookierunkingdom.fandom.com/wiki/Pure_Vanilla_Cookie">Pure Vanilla Cookie!</a></p>

Pure Vanilla is also is the founder and former king of the Vanilla Kingdom which is one of the strongest kingdoms in the lore. </p> 	<p>I ADORE this cookie as his lore makes me understand as a player how sweet and caring he is! He is also a exceptional healer and considered META making him not only a likable character personality wise... but also in gamemodes! </p>
